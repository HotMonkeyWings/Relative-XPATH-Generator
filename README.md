# Relative-XPATH-Generator
Javascript code that generates the human level relative xpaths

- To generate your xpath, simply copy this code and paste this in your developer console. 
- If there is an error message, then type 'allow pasting' in the console and paste the code again.
- Then, just right click on any element you want the xpath of and the xpath will be generated in the console.
- When the page navigates to a different url or different page, or if the page is refreshed, the console will be refreshed and you will have to repaste the code again.
  

  To open the developer console, either hold down - ctrl + shift + i or right click and select inspect in the context menu

  Note : This script will disable the context menu on right clicking temporarily as long as the script is active.
